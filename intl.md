# Intl Work Group

The Intl Working Group is dedicated to support and improvement of
internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in Node.  Responsibilities
include:

* Reviewing the addition or modification of APIs and features within Node that
  support i18n / l10n.
* Addressing and triaging i18n / l10n issues in the issue tracker.
* Authoring and editing i18n / l10n related API documentation
* Working to ensure alignment between Node and V8 Intl implementation and
  [EcmaScript 402 i18n standard](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402)
* Working to evolve the current state of the Intl API within Node and
  EcmaScript.

This working group does not address the localization (translation) of Node-related
websites or documentation, nor primarily the translation of Node's own error messages.
It may have a liason relationship to those documents.

Initial proposed members include:
  + Steven Loomis
  + James M Snell
  + + other interested parties from Node.js and io.js communities
